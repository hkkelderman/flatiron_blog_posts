I currently work as a research analyst for an environmental nonprofit in Washington, D.C., the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP). Up until a year ago, I spent most of my time as an analyst organizing and analyzing data in Microsoft Excel. Data cleaning took forever and I was always worried about the accuracy of the analysis, since it required many repetitive steps for different variables. 

Then, about a year ago, I was introduced to the data programming language R, and with EIP’s help, I enrolled with Datacamp and completed a variety of courses and career tracks focused on R and data science. Learning R has dramatically changed the way I work. Though not all of the projects I work on have allowed the use of R, for the projects that do, R has made a huge difference. Where I used to spend days running the same analysis for a variety of variables, I now have the ability to write code that will allow for the analysis of all those variables in a matter of minutes.

My skills with R have greatly impacted the work at EIP, and I understand the power that programming and data science can bring to small organizations like mine. For example, we maintain a website called [Ashtracker](http://ashtracker.org/), which presents groundwater contamination from coal ash disposal sites. In 2017, companies that owned 265 different coal ash disposal sites were required to report a year’s worth of groundwater monitoring data. Our organization, with the help of a few partner groups, collected,
entered, checked, and finally presented all of that data on our website. With the use of a script I wrote in R, I was solely responsible for the final check, making sure there were no errors in our data. The data was also published in a report, where with the help of R, I got to run analysis on all the data we had put together. Just for reference, each site had between 8 and 20 different groundwater monitoring wells, each well measured concentrations for 21 different contaminants, and each well measured those contaminants on at least 8 different dates. The resulting dataframe was well over a million lines of data. But it was no problem to handle, thanks to R.

Fast forward to today, I chose to further my education in data science through Flatiron to further reinforce concepts learned in prior courses and to add new programming languages to my data toolkit. I know firsthand how helpful these skills are to small organizations and government entities, and I want to continue increasing efficiency and analytical capacity for organizations like EIP by learning them.
